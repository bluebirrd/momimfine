Mom, I'm fine
================================================================================
Stats about the trip for your terrified mom.

The story
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really love travelling abroad. Unfortunately, my mom doesn't, since she's always worrying whether the plane landed well, did I get to the hostel and other criterias of "everything is OK".

I don't really like reporting about my state every 2 hours, so I decided to create a web app that will collect all the data about my trip and show them to mom in one huge dashboard.

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Info about flights and bookings can be entered by traveler
2. Show info about flight (departure/arrival time, gates, status)
3. Interactive dashboard
4. Photos from Insta on dashboard
5. Info about check-ins on dashboard

(to be continued)

At the moment the project is only on the stage of idea, the code will appear later.
